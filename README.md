# CV With Rest API - The client

## Description
This client/site is a resume for me (ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª). It consumes data from a REST API that I've created using Laravel. The client uses HTML, JavaScript and CSS. During the development Gulp was used along with TypeScript and Sass. To set up the the project on a local environment, use the command `npm install`, and make sure that gulp-cli is installed. After this, run the command `gulp build` to build everything for the first time, and then simply type `gulp` to start everything.
